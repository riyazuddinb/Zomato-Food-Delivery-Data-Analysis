# Food Delivery App Data Analysis

**Project Description:**

This project aims to provide insights into the analysis of a real-world database using SQL and Python. It demonstrates how to extract valuable information from the dataset, preprocess the data for improved performance, and utilize structured query language to retrieve useful data from the database.

## Modules

### Module 1: Data Preprocessing

In this module, we perform data preprocessing tasks on the Food Delivery App dataset.

1. **Task 1: Pre-processing the data And Removing Unwanted Columns**
2. **Task 2: Renaming And Selecting Columns In A Dataset**
3. **Task 3: Dealing With Null Values In A Dataset**
4. **Task 4: Identifying Duplicate Data In A Dataset**
5. **Task 5: Text Cleaning**
6. **Task 6: Unique Value Check And Irrelevant Value Handling**
7. **Task 7: Cleaning And Exporting Zomato Dataset**
8. **Task 8: Data Cleaning And Analysis With Excel And MySQL**

### Module 2: Data Analysis Using SQL

In this module, we utilize SQL for data analysis on the Food Delivery App dataset.

1. **Task 1: For a high-level overview of the hotels, provide us the top 5 most voted hotels in the delivery category.**
2. **Task 2: For a particular location called Banashankari, find out the top 5 highly rated hotels in the delivery category.**
3. **Task 3: Compare the ratings of the cheapest and most expensive hotels in Indiranagar.**
4. **Task 4: Compare the total votes of restaurants that provide online ordering services and those that donâ€™t provide online ordering services.**
5. **Task 5: For each Restaurant type, find out the number of restaurants, total votes, and average rating. Display the data with the highest votes on the top (if the first row of output is NA, display the remaining rows).**
6. **Task 6: What is the most liked dish of the most-voted restaurant on Zomato (as the restaurant has a tie-up with Zomato, the restaurant compulsorily provides online ordering and delivery facilities).**
7. **Task 7: List the top 15 restaurants which have a minimum of 150 votes, have a rating greater than 3, and are currently not providing online ordering. Display the restaurants with the highest votes on the top.**
